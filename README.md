## Text2Scribble

**Text2Scribble** is a lightweight, browser-based web app that converts typed text into realistic handwritten-style pages.

Built for **students, creators**, and **developers** who want the look of handwriting—without the pain of actually writing it.

### Why I Built This

Let's be honest—**writing long assignments by hand is exhausting, time-consuming, and repetitive.**

I created Text2Scribble because:

- I hate rewriting the same content again and again for handwritten submissions
- Writing by hand wastes hours that could be spent learning or building
- Many schools still require handwritten assignments—even in a digital world
- Digital notes don't always "look" personal or authentic
- I wanted a clean, frontend-only project that solves a real, everyday problem

### How Image Generation Works

Text2Scribble uses **html2canvas** to capture the handwritten page and export it as an image.

**Flow:**
- Type or paste your text
- Choose a handwriting font
- Click Generate Image
- Right-click → Save image as…

### Sample Output
